#There are 3 different parts
#Part 1 is Collatz Conjecture. This takes a positive integer that the user enters. Then goes through the steps of Collatz Conjecture.
#Part 2 is a prime number checker. User inputs a number greater than 1. The program goes from 2 to the inputed number -1 checking if it is divisible. If it is not then it is a prime number
#Part 3 Outputs the multiplication table
